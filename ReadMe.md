## üíª Setup instructions
### üß© Clone the repo üß©
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zoeyzuo-se/azure-apim-identity-delegation-sample.git
    ```

### üîí Configure Auth0 üîí

1. Create a new Auth0 account at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
    > If prompted, select `Database` for authentication.
2. Select Applications in the left menu and click the Create Application button.
3. Name your new app and select `Regular Web App Applications`.
4. Click the Create button.
5. Select the Settings tab.
6. Add the following URL to the `Allowed Callback URLs` list. Separated by a comma:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000/callback,
    https://\<your-web-app-name\>.azurewebsites.net/callback,
    https://\<your-apim-name\>.developer.azure-api.net/callback
    ```
7. Add the following URL to the `Allowed Logout URLs` list:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000,
    https://\<your-web-app-name\>.azurewebsites.net
    https://\<your-apim-name\>.developer.azure-api.net
    ```
8. Save the changes.
9. Copy and paste the Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret values into the `.env` file in the root of this project. They should match to the following keys respectively: `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### üå≥ Environment Variables üå≥
To run the environment successfully, please make sure to fill in the following environment variables in the `.env` file in the root of this project.

Here's a brief description of each environment variable:

- `PERSONAL_SUB_ID`: Your personal subscription ID.
- `SUFFIX`: The suffix for your environment.
- `PUB_EMAIL`: Your public email address.
- `PUB_NAME`: Your public name.
- `DELEGATION_KEY`: Your delegation key.
- `ACR_NAME`: The name of your Azure Container Registry (ACR). This should be globally unique.
- `ACR_REPO_NAME`: The name of your ACR repository.
- `IMAGE_TAG`: The tag for the Docker image.

Additionally, you will need to obtain the following values from Auth0:

- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: Your Auth0 client ID.
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: Your Auth0 domain.
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Auth0 client secret.

Make sure to provide the correct values for these variables to ensure proper authentication and authorization within the environment.

Note: It's important to keep sensitive information, such as personal IDs and secrets, private and secure. Be cautious when sharing your `.env` file or these values with others.

### üöò Deploy Azure resources üöò
- Run the following command to deploy the Azure resources:
    ```bash
    make deploy
    ```
- This will deploy the following resources:
    - Azure Container Registry
    - Azure APIM instance
    - Azure App Service Plan
    - Azure Web App
- This will also set up the following permissions:
    - Give Azure Web App `ACRPull` role access to the Azure Container Registry.
    - Give Azure Web App `Contributor` role access to the Azure APIM instance. This is for creating users in the APIM instance.
- Run `make buildimage` and `make pushimage` to build and push the docker image to the Azure Container Registry.

## üöÄ Usage
### üåê Publish developer portal on APIM
Publish your API Management developer portal following the tutorial [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize#publish-from-the-azure-portal).
### üîê Signup and Login to the developer portal!
SignUp will create a user in the Auth0 Database and also create a user in the APIM instance.

Login will authenticate the user with Auth0 and then delegate the user to the APIM instance.
